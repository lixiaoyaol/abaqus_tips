# Fortran程序编写
- 需要注意的地方：参考[这里](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/gotchas/)
- [Note](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/gotchas) : a common misconception is that the .f90 source files are restricted to the Fortran 90 revision of the standard and cannot contain features introduced in more recent revisions (Fortran 95/2003/2008/2018).
This is wrong and completely unrelated: the only reason why .f90 has been chosen is that the free form has been introduced in the Fortran 90 revision. Both .f and .f90 source files can contain features from any revision of the standard.  
**Fortran 的语法不被后缀名所限制**
